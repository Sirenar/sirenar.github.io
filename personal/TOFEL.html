Education opens your eyes to the world around you.</p> <p>Think of your knowledge in a specific domain as a tree. The fruit is what we see in front of us: it's the unearned knowledge that we can obtain, experience, and repeat right away. It's a very shallow understanding of the tree but it's not untrue. On the other hand, a first principles thinker will understand that body of knowledge from the fruit all the way down to the root. They will see that the apple is connected to a branch, and every branch is a subset of a greater whole called the trunk. Finally, they see that the root is the most fundamental part of the tree which gives rise to the fruit.</p> <p>果实就是我们眼前所见：这是我们可以立即获得、体验和重复的不劳而获的知识。 这是对树的非常肤浅的理解，但并非不真实。 另一方面，第一原理思想家会从果实到根部理解整个知识体系。</p> <h4 id="soft-skills"><a href="#soft-skills" class="header-anchor">#</a> soft skills</h4> <p>When someone applies for a job, there are certain hard skills they need to have like data analysis or bookkeeping.

Perhaps you think asking for help is a sign of weakness; that if you ask for help you’re admitting you’re inadequate in some way; that you lack knowledge, skill or experience to do something yourself. You don’t want anyone to see that you’re struggling; you want people to think that you’re in control and can handle things. You may not want to come across as annoying or unintelligent, but speaking up is likely to have the opposite effect. It’s OK to ask for help.

They are called basic sciences <strong>because they provide a fundamental understanding of natural phenomena and the processes by which natural resources are transformed</strong>.</p> <p>Age appropriate, weekly chores, whether it’s taking out the garbage, emptying the dishwasher, folding clean laundry, cleaning the cat litter box, or light yard work like raking leaves, can help a child develop character.</p> <p>On issue of concern turning into an obsession for a plethora of parents is the difficulties and importance of taking care of young children. It is crystal clear that a blame can brings about some terrible consequences. Different people have distinct perspectives in regard to whether or not older children should be responsible to take care of younger kids. Although it is a little cumbersome to reach a consensus on this issue, a large percentage of parents prefer do the task by themselves. Conversely, I, to a great extent, disagree with the point of view which children should not allow to take of younger ones. My reasons are manifold, among which the most significant ones are substantiated in the following paragraphs.</p> <p><strong>To commence with</strong>, the first exquisite point to be mentioned is that many activities which children do in their childhood is a proportion of their train. As a matter of fact, when they take the responsibility of others, they are preparing for the future since they will have to shoulder the responsibility of numerous tasks. Actually, they find that some of the responsibilities are really influential, and they cannot put the blame on others According to a noteworthy statistics of a research, conducted at the University of Tehran, the children who have to be responsible for numerous activities will be more prosperous in the future. The results show 8 out of 10 people who had to look after their young siblings were more successful when they got older.</p> <p>Beyond a shadow of a doubt, almost all individuals have to take care of their children some day. Therefore, they should learn this skill as well as other momentous activities during their childhood. Although numerous adults think that it may cause several terrible happenings, others completely disagree .In other words, when they are younger, they have the opportunity to do it while their parents control it. Hence, they may less likely do something wrong, and consequently, they will be prepared in the future. For instance, they learn how to feed babies based on their characteristics.</p> <p>Last but not least, taking care of children is a tough responsibility which is often done by parents. Unfortunately, many children turn a blind eyes to the kindness of parents. As a result, children should look after younger kids to understand how difficult it is. I may contribute to forming a more respectful son or daughter, on the grounds that they realize during their different stages of life who sacrifices his/her life to have better living.</p> <p>To sum up, considering the aforementioned arguments, we may draw the conclusion that children should have the chance to take the responsibility of younger siblings. Not only does it increase their information and knowledge, but it also helps them to become more responsible towards their works and acts. Moreover, if children experience such arduous activities like their parents, they conceive and respect their parents more.</p></div> <div class="article-copyright"><ul><li
