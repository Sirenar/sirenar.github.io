Nowadays, (We’ve never lived in an age of such abundance of choices/With the overwork culture thriving), people are often occupied with lots of things like workload, school demands and responsibilities.

It's easy to get caught in our comfort zone -- after all, it's comfortable there!(Meeting new students, making connections, and building relationships will all help down the line when we’re looking for a job.) By ... , we may meet people from far off but share at least a few of the same interests(values, perspectives) as ourselves), diversify our friendships(broaden social circles) and break free of this(build our networks), and thus, experience(open up) opportunities we would have missed out on otherwise.</p> <h4 id="sustain-relationships"><a href="#sustain-relationships" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sustain Relationships</h4> <p>Human beings are naturally social creatures. And when we consider that one-third of our lives is spend at work, it's (crystal) clear that good relationships with colleagues(fellows, co-workers) will make our jobs more cheerful(enjoyable). A strong network of people supporting us helps keep us from loneliness, decrease our stress, and helps us advanced social primates just chill out.</p> <p>Also, building relationships is often the groundwork that must be laid before anything else gets done on a project. We need ...(to check in with our partners) to sharpen our empathy to understand the position of our partner, this helps us be there for each other when we need it the most rather than relying on fixing our issues alone. <em>When we hit roadblocks and aren’t sure we can proceed, the relationships around us provide strength and support.</em></p> <p>No need to say that the professional connections we make will also help to further our career(down the line when we're looking for a job/pave the way for fulfilling career).</p> <h4 id="true-friendship"><a href="#true-friendship" class="header-anchor">#</a> True Friendship</h4> <p>A true friend goes beyond the surface, any true friendship requires some level of vulnerability. They are able to have difficult conversations in telling you things that sometimes you may not be eager to hear. The key is that they do it in love and with grace. They don't tear you down but rather a true friend will hold you to a standard they know your character is worthy of(encourage you to be a better version of yourself).</p> <p>Although a true friend may encourage you to make good decisions, they trust your judgment and respect your own personal judgments. They don’t become passive aggressive when they give advice you don’t accept, instead, they respect boundaries and value your feelings and thoughts. They don’t push you to become who they want you to be, instead, they celebrate what makes you uniquely you.</p> <blockquote><p>A true friend is someone who has you back, no matter what. A real friend stays with you through traumas, disappointments, mental health crises, and physical maladies.</p></blockquote> <h4 id="set-boundaries"><a href="#set-boundaries" class="header-anchor">#</a> Set boundaries</h4> <p>It's imperative to practice saying no. Maybe you do not want to come across as mean or selfish(unkind), but saying no to one thing means saying yes to another. Setting personal boundaries is an equivalent of a front door to our hearts. We can open or shut this door whenever we need. Thus we'll be able to prioritize and focus on our own needs(for self-care).</p> <p>Setting boundaries is the real secret in achieving a healthy life balance. Respectfully declining a task that may be too time-consuming(to attend something that would have taken time) could mean more sleep, an evening of Netflix, or quality time with families.</p> <ul><li>We all have limits in our relationships, and ignoring those limits can lead to feelings of resentment.</li> <li>Shift our relationships to become more honest, authentic, and free of resentment.</li> <li>Friendship can be strengthened or be broken by the words we utter from our mouths.</li></ul> <h4 id="handle-complaints"><a href="#handle-complaints" class="header-anchor">#</a> Handle Complaints</h4> <p>Remember that it takes effort to complain. Most unhappy customers won’t bother to complain—they’ll simply and quietly take their business elsewhere. A customer who takes the time to share(provide) their feedback, even if it is negative(we are not eager to hear), is giving us the opportunity to respond(for growth) and make things right. We can choose to see that as a gift. It provides valuable feedback that can ultimately help your business improve.</p> <h3 id="learning-approach"><a href="#learning-approach" class="header-anchor">#</a> Learning Approach</h3> <p>School is fast-paced, rigorous, and challenging. With each successive grade level, the content becomes increasingly more difficult and those who (are able to tap into their vocabulary bank) will have an easier time with all subjects.</p> <h4 id="learn-to-study"><a href="#learn-to-study" class="header-anchor">#</a> Learn to Study</h4> <blockquote><p>Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school. — <strong>Albert Einstein</strong>.</p></blockquote> <p>The aim of education is not about the bunch(a collection) of data and information you hold in your head or the grades of your final examination, but about the learning habit, the intelligent way we think, the morals and ethics.</p> <ul><li>Always be in a state of curiosity. Be inquisitive.</li></ul> <h4 id="learn-from-others"><a href="#learn-from-others" class="header-anchor">#</a> Learn From Others</h4> <p>Learning is a two-way street. (Learning is a practice, not an event.) When we ... we're open to learning from others, and we benefit from their experience as well as our own and we can inherit their wisdom and knowledge. (Often we don't have to acquire all the knowledge on our own. (Collaboration and) sharing just make it twice as much.)</p> <p>when we discuss with peers, we develop and strengthen(refine/hone) interpersonal communication skills as well as analytical and critical thinking skills, because during the discussion we put forward an opinion through the process of reasoning, and support it by evidence.</p> <p>Nevertheless, When you argue(debate) with people who share different ideas(opposing views), you learn more not only about their perspective, but more about yourself as well. Once you are fully aware of your views and perspective, you will become more of an individual.</p> <p>::: tips Homework</p> <p>Colleges develop and hone soft skills through course requirements like essays, presentations, and group projects.</p> <p>:::</p> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>DETAILS</summary> <p>foster learning and comprehension</p> <p>explain concepts and clarify any doubts you have</p></details> <h4 id="learn-from-past"><a href="#learn-from-past" class="header-anchor">#</a> Learn from Past</h4> <p>Our past is a treasure chest filled with learning opportunities for our present and future, but only if we look inside. Experience, also called empirical knowledge gives us the tools to analyze and explain problems in the past.</p> <p><strong>Provides perspective</strong>. And It positions us to see patterns that might otherwise be invisible in the present, thus providing a crucial perspective for understanding and solving current and future problems.</p> <p>Rather than a dry collection of names and dates, the history tell us about the import intersection of time and place that defines who we are. (make sense of how it has grown and developed.)</p> <p>As a result, it helps us become more impartial and thoughtful as decision-makers.</p> <blockquote><p>&quot;Those who cannot learn from history are bound(doomed/condemned) to repeat it.&quot;  — Spanish philosopher George Santayana
Consider what happens when you meet someone for the first time. The conversation usually begins with a series of questions such as, “Where did you grow up?””How long have you lived here?”“Where did you go to school?” The importance of history in defining who we are cannot be overstated.</p></blockquote> <h4 id="learn-from-history"><a href="#learn-from-history" class="header-anchor">#</a> Learn from History</h4> <p>The past is a treasure chest filled with learning opportunities for our present and future, but only if we look inside. Through history, we can learn how past societies, systems, ideologies, governments, cultures and technologies were built, how they operated, and how they have changed(over time).</p> <p>And It positions us to see patterns that might otherwise be invisible in the present.</p> <p>All this knowledge makes them more rounded people who are better prepared to learn in all their academic subjects.</p> <h4 id="early-work-experience"><a href="#early-work-experience" class="header-anchor">#</a> Early Work Experience</h4> <p>Even students who work in places not connected to their majors will look more impressive to potential employers. They'll have some kind of work experience on their resumes to start, and the fact that they've been able to hold (down) a job while attending school attests to their level of maturity, responsibility and time management. Employers look for employees who understand the work environment and work well as part of a team. Having a part-time job shows that the student is at least somewhat accustomed to the professional world, which will make the transition that much easier.</p> <h3 id="virtues"><a href="#virtues" class="header-anchor">#</a> Virtues</h3> <h4 id="brutal-honesty"><a href="#brutal-honesty" class="header-anchor">#</a> Brutal Honesty</h4> <p>In the long run, the honesty always outweighs any short term benefit.</p> <h4 id="fairness"><a href="#fairness" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fairness</h4> <h4 id="obey-the-rules"><a href="#obey-the-rules" class="header-anchor">#</a> Obey the Rules</h4> <p>Even though some regulations in the workplace seem trite and insignificant, many protect the rights and safety of employees. Following rules and regulations help employees understand what is expected of them and what will happen if they violate the rules. It makes for an environment of predictability and consistency where people feel safe to come to work, to be themselves and to go about their business. The result is less turnover, more teamwork and higher company morale.</p> <p>provide a sense of predictability and consistency</p> <h3 id="work-related-preferences"><a href="#work-related-preferences" class="header-anchor">#</a> Work-related Preferences</h3> <h4 id="do-more-with-less"><a href="#do-more-with-less" class="header-anchor">#</a> Do More with Less</h4> <p>There’s not a single person on the planet who wouldn’t like to make more money while working less at the same time.</p> <p>Passion</p> <p>Resonate with my persona, my dream, my aspiration.</p> <p>Turn their passions into profitable, scalable, sustainable businesses.</p> <h4 id="work-in-teams"><a href="#work-in-teams" class="header-anchor">#</a> Work in teams</h4> <p>When you’re part of a (study) group, you’re accountable to more than just yourself.  Your friends are depending on you to be there(show up) at the regularly scheduled meetings. This will increase(stimulate) your (internal/intrinsic) motivation(provide incentives) for studying and curb procrastination.</p> <p><em>Group working</em> can make study more efficient and fun. &quot;Two heads are better than one.&quot; / &quot;None of us is as smart as all of us.&quot; Working with others enables you to pool your ideas and see problems from different perspectives. Groups have a greater well of resources to tap and more information available because of the variety of backgrounds and experiences. If you are working to a limited time frame, group work allows analysis to a greater(go further in) depth and breadth than if you were working individually.</p> <h4 id="money-vs-passion"><a href="#money-vs-passion" class="header-anchor">#</a> Money vs Passion</h4> <p>Wealth can give the luxuries of life, but it cannot give mental peace and satisfaction.</p> <p>Money is a very powerful thing. It builds empires and breaks down kingdoms; it allows for dreams to come true and it takes others away; it makes some people happy and others completely miserable. Today the pursuit of money is almost directly linked to the pursuit of happiness</p> <h4 id="competitive"><a href="#competitive" class="header-anchor">#</a> Competitive</h4> <p>A strong and positive corporate culture can maintain high morale, empower workers to make decisions and develop a team spirit that fosters collaboration and innovation. The flip side to that is the detrimental effect that weak, negative corporate cultures have on the bottom line. It leads to a selfish atmosphere where the best employees flee and everyone looks out only for their own interests.</p> <h4 id="blend-work-life"><a href="#blend-work-life" class="header-anchor">#</a> Blend work-life</h4> <p>New technologies such as e-mail and smartphones exacerbate this impatience and anxiety. E-mail etiquette often necessitates a response within 24 hours, with the general understanding that sooner is better. Managing this constant and mounting demand often involves switching tasks or multi-tasking, and the job never quite feels done…Multi-tasking is what makes us feel pressed for time.</p> <p>If work is your life, then how do you disconnect?</p> <p>The idea that work begins and ends at the office is intuitively wrong. We laugh at silly clips of dog antics (animal pictures) on our work computers, and we answer emails on our couches in front of the TV. On the one hand, flexibility is nice. On the other, blending work and leisure creates an always-on expectation that makes it hard for white-collar workers to escape the shadow of work responsibilities.</p> <h3 id="regular-workouts"><a href="#regular-workouts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Regular Workouts</h3> <h4 id="for-youth"><a href="#for-youth" class="header-anchor">#</a> For Youth</h4> <p>Getting a regular workout/Engaging in a physical activity help me fall asleep and relieves/decreases insomnia(ensure better quality and consistent sleep), taking the high prevalence(incidence) of insomnia into consideration.</p> <p>Sleep is important. When you properly rest, your brain strenghthens the knowledge you have learned during the day by assimilating information so the better you sleep, the better you learn. (The correlation(connection/relationship) between sleeping and learning is often disregarded by some busy students but we should be aware(conscious) of the importance of this essential element of the learning process. )</p> <p>Cardiovascular/Aerobic/Cardio exercises like walking, jogging, biking, burpees, sit ups enhance and increase our stamina and endurance level, burn off extra calories, and help us get trim and toned. All those achievements can add up to a boost of self-esteem—and the confidence that comes with it.</p> <h4 id="for-seniors"><a href="#for-seniors" class="header-anchor">#</a> For Seniors</h4> <p>Seniors should opt for an active lifestyle instead of a sedentary one, but avoid overexerting one’s self. Getting a regular workout/Engaging in a physical activity help old adults fall asleep and relieves/decreases insomnia, taking the high prevalence(incidence) of insomnia into consideration. (Those who fall asleep faster, sleep longer, and have better quality sleep, will also have lower instances of depression, and report a general sense of well-being. )</p> <p>Most cardiovascular/aerobic/cardio exercises like walking, jogging, dancing, yoga will do the trick, but seniors need to take some precautions with exercise because their bodies tend to be more fragile than younger people’s bodies. An injury while exercising could take longer to heal or cause complications for an elderly person.</p> <h3 id="problem-solving-strategies"><a href="#problem-solving-strategies" class="header-anchor">#</a> Problem-solving Strategies</h3> <p>If you’re like me, you’ve got at least a few browser windows open (each one loaded with tabs you “<em>need</em>”). Your email inbox is steadily filling up in the background.</p> <h4 id="avoid-multitasking"><a href="#avoid-multitasking" class="header-anchor">#</a> Avoid Multitasking</h4> <p>Do two things at once is to do neither./Two steps forward, one step back. We should engage our full attention to the task at hand. (This is an equivalent of hanging a &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign in our minds.) Thus we'll be able to prioritize and achieve.</p> <p>This one-at-a-time approach is the real secret in achieving a healthy life balance. If we follow through to completion and reap the reward of accomplishments, we will experience a powerful feeling of being in control and successful.</p> <h4 id="see-the-big-picture"><a href="#see-the-big-picture" class="header-anchor">#</a> See the big picture</h4> <p>Whether it’s your personal life or a work project, it’s easy to get bogged down and lost in the details. Being creative and letting your mind meander a bit</p> <h4 id="time-management"><a href="#time-management" class="header-anchor">#</a> Time management</h4> <p>Deadlines hold us accountable to finish our work within the required(limited) timeframe. Failing to meet deadlines means failure to deliver on what you said you would. And it may cause trouble for others, since the person who assigns you the task probably has a subsequent deadline in mind.
